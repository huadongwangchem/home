abstract: The frustrated Lewis pair comprised of B(C<sub>6</sub>F<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub> and a boryl–borate lithium salt Li[pinBB(Ph)pin] can efficiently activate dihydrogen, pinacolborane and ethylene at ambient temperature. Theoretical studies suggest that the nucleophilic sp<sup>2</sup> boryl moiety of Li[pinBB(Ph)pin] plays different roles in these reactions.
