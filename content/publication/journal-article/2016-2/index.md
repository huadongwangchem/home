abstract: 2,6-Lutidine and its derivatives in the presence of B(C<sub>6</sub>F<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub> undergo tautomerization to yield the corresponding enamine·B(C<sub>6</sub>F<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3<sub> adducts when catecholborane is applied as a precatalyst. This reaction provides a straightforward way for benzylic C–H borylation of lutidines.
