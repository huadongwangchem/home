abstract: <b>Golden frustration:</b> The facile activation of terminal alkynes with a frustrated Lewis pair (<b>1</b> and 1,4‐diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO)) enables the development of an efficient boroauration reaction. This process can be achieved directly from alkynes, a hydroborane, [PPh<sub>3</sub>AuCl], and an organic base. Ar<sup>F</sup>=2,4,6‐tris(trifluoromethyl)phenyl.
