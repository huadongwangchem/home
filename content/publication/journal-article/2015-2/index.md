abstract: A bulky organoborane ArF<sub>2</sub>BMe (Ar<sup>F</sup> = 2,4,6-tris(trifluoromethyl)phenyl, <b>1</b>) has been synthesized. In C<sub>6</sub>D<sub>6</sub> solution this organoborane and pyridine form a frustrated Lewis pair. Under mild conditions, <b>1</b> can efficiently catalyze 1,4-hydroboration of a series of pyridines. This reaction is highly chemo- and regioselective. The reaction intermediate, a boronium complex [Py<sub>2</sub>Bpin]\[Ar<sup>F</sup><sub>2</sub>B(H)Me\] (<b>3</b>), was characterized in solution by NMR spectroscopy, which was also confirmed by DFT calculation.
