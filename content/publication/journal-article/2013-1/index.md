abstract: <b>Out with the metal :</b> Metal‐free hydrogenation of unfunctionalized olefins can be achieved by employing HB(C<sub>6</sub>F<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub> as the catalyst. The key step in the catalytic reaction is believed to involve a novel borane‐mediated σ‐bond metathesis, which has been investigated both experimentally and theoretically.
