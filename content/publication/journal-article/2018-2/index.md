abstract: Reaction of Mes<sub>2</sub>P(O)Li with (C<sub>6</sub>F<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>BCl gave access to an oxygen-linked germinal intramolecular frustrated Lewis pair Mes<sub>2</sub>P(O)B(C<sub>6</sub>F<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub> (<b>1</b>). Compound <b>1</b> is stable at room temperature and only decomposes when heated to 90 Â°C. NMR analysis and theoretical analysis revealed the frustrated nature between the boron and phosphorus centers. Compound <b>1</b> shows typical frustrated Lewis pair reactivity when treated with dihydrogen, carbon dioxide, alkyne and alkene. The reaction of <b>1</b> with isoprene resulted in selective formation of 3,4-phosphoryl/boryl addition product <b>8</b>.
