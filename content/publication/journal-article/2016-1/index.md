abstract: Two 2,4,6-tris(trifluoromethyl)phenyl-substituted 2-(lutidinyl)organoboranes (<b>5a</b> and <b>5b</b>) were prepared. These complexes can function as intramolecular vicinal B/N frustrated Lewis pairs to heterolytically activate dihydrogen. When these complexes were treated with HBpin, two different reaction pathways took place. Whereas the reaction between <b>5a</b> and HBpin affords a formal ligand-redistribution product, the reaction of <b>5b</b> with HBpin leads to a dearomative dehydroborylation product.
