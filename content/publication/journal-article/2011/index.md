abstract: <b>Channeling the frustration:</b> Frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) consisting of ArF<sub>2</sub>BH <b>1</b> with NEt<sub>3</sub> or DABCO can activate H<sub>2</sub> under mild conditions. Theoretical calculations suggest two distinct reaction pathways for these two FLPs. For the “more frustrated” ArF<sub>2</sub>BH/NEt<sub>3</sub>, H<sub>2</sub> is activated in a stepwise manner; for the “less frustrated” ArF<sub>2</sub>BH/DABCO, H2 is activated in a concerted fashion (see scheme).
