Although σ-bond metathesis is one of most ubiquitous transformations for transition metal complexes, activation of enthalpically strong bonds via σ-bond metathesis with main group complexes still remains underexplored. We discovered that electrophilic organoboranes or boreniums can activate dihydrogen via σ-bond metathesis. Our studies have shown that such reactivity can be applied in catalytic hydrogenation of unfunctionalized alkenes. More recently, employing an o-carboranyl-substituted borenium complex, we successfully isolated the first high-valent η<sup>2</sup>-σ-silane complex, a long presumed intermediate in σ-bond metathesis. We are now investigating the use of borenium complexes in sp<sup>3</sup> C-H bond activation.

We have developed a series of 2,4,6-tris(trifluoromethyl)phenyl substituted organboranes, which can be combined with various Lewis bases to activate small molecules such as H<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub> and alkynes. In particular, we discovered that one of these organoboranes can function as a catalyst for selective 1,4-hydroboration of pyridines.
